Grails DTO Plugin
-----------------

Ever tried to create and maintain DTO classes for your domain classes? It's a pain.
This plugin automates both the creation of the DTO classes and the binding of domain
instances to those DTOs.

To create a DTO, just run the command:

  grails generate-dto Book

This will generate DTOs for both Book and any of its relations. The DTO classes can
be found under "src/java". Want to create DTOs for all your domain classes? Simple:

  grails generate-dto --all

Once you've generated the DTO source files, how do you convert from domain instances
to the corresponding DTOs? The plugin provides two options:

1) domainObject as DTO
2) domainObject.toDTO()

That's it! Hope you enjoy.
